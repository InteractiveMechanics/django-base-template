## An introduction to The Ur Project ##

The Ur Project is a dynamic new collaboration between the British Museum,
and the Penn Museum. We hope that also the Iraq Museum will become a
partner in the future. The project takes the long-standing and successful
cooperation as exemplified by the Ur excavations into the 21st century, by
digitally reunifying the remarkable finds from the city of Ur in a
state-of-the-art online facility. Every object recovered is being
digitised and researched, the cuneiform tablets are being translated,
whilst the original excavation photographs, the archives, plans, and other
documents, are being scanned and indexed. All this data will be made
freely available in an open neoteric database that will preserve the
complete finds and records in digital formats for posterity. The
unification of this diverse information into a single resource, from
photographs of Agatha Christie, to excavation diaries and the find-spots
of individual artefacts, will enable research that has hitherto been
impossible. Our desired outcomes are to stimulate a new level of interest,
and open new avenues of research by scholars and students from a range of
fields such as archaeology, history, Assyriology, anthropology, art and
architectural history, as well as to engage non-expert audiences in the
astonishing remains of this wonderful site. The second phase of the
project started in July 2013, it is titled *Ur of the Chaldees: A Virtual
Vision of Woolley's excavations*, and it was made possible by $1.28
million in lead support from the Leon Levy Foundation.

## Project goals ##

Our multi-faceted website will present for the first time an authoritative
set of high resolution images of the finds, integrated with all field
notes, catalogs, photos, reports, maps, letters, publications. The
cuneiform inscriptions are being transliterated and translated into
English. Importantly, all data will be recorded in a format that allows it
to be fully extractable and taggable, enabling researchers to create their
own datasets and make comparisons with their own research. A further
significant outcome will be that the reintegrated records will allow us to
re-establish lost object identifications and crucial find-spot information.

We will relate internal references between notes, letters, publications
and catalogs, connect artefacts to their find-spots on maps, and link
wherever possible to other resources with the goal of enabling researchers
to analyse the site in radical new ways. Our understanding of Ur and the
ancient Near East will improve dramatically, fostering an era of
intensified research centred upon Ur, using the unparalleled wealth of
resources that we will make available.

## Architecture ##

The UrOnline Digital Resource is supported by a number of open source technologies,
including Django (web framework), Solr (indexing), MySQL (database backend), 
and Haystack (search module for Django). The Django 1.6 base template was forked from 
Xenith's original base template repository. This version of the UrOnline Digital Resource
is part of Phase 1 of the website's development schedule. During Phase 2, we hope to 
combine aspects of our work with OpenContext v.2 currently being developed by Eric
Kansa to expand our project to include Open Data capabilities.

## Prerequisites ##

- Python 2.6 or 2.7
- pip
- virtualenv (virtualenvwrapper is recommended for use during development)

## Installation ##

The project is still currently in development. More information about installation
instructions will become available at the end of Phase 1, scheduled for August 2014.
